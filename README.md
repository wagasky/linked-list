# James and Melissa's Sweet Linked List

We built a handy, dandy solution to help you bookmark all of your favorite sites! You can enter a title and a URL and save those to things to a card. Then you can read those articles and after, mark them as read. Finally, you can keep track of how many articles you've read and how you many you have bookmarked.
